        <p>
            My fisrt post is about why i started stuyding computing. When I first decided to study computing, I had no idea where this journey would take me. It wasn’t just about learning to code or understanding how software works—it was about exploring an entire world of endless possibilities. Looking back, I can pinpoint a few key reasons why I chose this path, and I’m excited to share them with you.<br>
A Natural Curiosity for Technology
I’ve always been fascinated by how things work; especially computer programming. 
That curiosity eventually grew into a desire to learn more about the bigger picture: how does software get made? How do computers think? And most importantly, how can I use technology to solve real-world problems as well as how it can help my public health career. <br>For me, computing isn't just about writing lines of code—it's about problem-solving. The more I learned about programming, the more I realized that coding is like learning a new language for solving complex problems. Every time you sit down to code, you’re given a problem to solve. It might be small—like figuring out how to sort a list of numbers—but it can also be huge, like developing software that helps doctors save lives.<br>

I love that computing allows me to be creative while also using logic and reasoning. It’s the perfect mix of analytical thinking and imagination, and I find that challenge incredibly motivating. There’s something deeply satisfying about debugging a piece of code and watching it finally run smoothly, knowing that i've made something work from scratch.<br>
Another big reason I decided to study computing is the sheer variety of career paths it opens up. Technology is everywhere, and the demand for skilled professionals is growing exponentially. Whether it's software development, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data science, or game development, there are so many exciting fields to explore. For someone who loves learning and is always up for a challenge, computing offers an abundance of opportunities to me.

What excites me the most is that I don’t have to know exactly where I want to end up right now. The world of computing is vast and constantly evolving. Today’s emerging technology could lead to a completely new career path in just a few years. I’m passionate about the idea of being able to adapt and explore as technology continues to advance.<br>
As I delved deeper into computing, I also began to see how technology can be used to make a real-world impact. Whether it’s creating apps that improve people’s lives, developing systems to tackle climate change, or building AI that helps solve global challenges, computing has the potential to make a difference.

I want to be part of that change. I believe that the skills I’m developing now will not only give me a fulfilling career, but also equip me with the tools to address some of the world’s most pressing problems. Technology isn’t just a career choice—it’s a way to shape the future.<br>When I first started studying computing, I didn’t know exactly where the path would lead. But the more I learn, the more I realize that the possibilities are truly limitless. Whether I’m building my own projects, diving into new technologies, or collaborating with others, I feel like I’m on an exciting journey.

I’m still just getting started, but I’m more excited than ever to see where this path takes me. If you're considering studying computing or just curious about it, I’d say: go for it! It’s a field that challenges you, helps you grow, and opens up a world of opportunities. And who knows? Maybe one day we’ll work together on something that changes the world.

        <p>
            When I first started studying computing, I had no idea just how much it would change me. I thought it was all about writing code and understanding algorithms—but what I’ve learned over the past few weeks goes so much deeper than that. Computing is transforming the way I think, solve problems, and view the world. As I continue this journey, I’m excited to share how these changes are unfolding, and how they’re shaping the person I’m becoming.<br> One of the biggest transformations I’ve experienced is in my mindset. When I first started, I often doubted myself. The terminology was unfamiliar, and the challenges seemed overwhelming. There were times when I’d look at a problem and think, how can i possibly solve this. But slowly, through constant practice and exposure, I’ve come to realize that I can figure things out.

Computing has taught me that failure is not the end; it’s just part of the process. It’s normal to encounter errors in your code, run into bugs, or get stuck. What matters is persistence, resilience, and the ability to troubleshoot. Each time I overcame an obstacle—whether that was fixing a bug in my code or solving a particularly tricky algorithm—I felt a sense of achievement that pushed me to tackle even bigger challenges.

This shift in my thinking has been one of the most profound changes in this journey. I now approach problems with confidence, knowing that the solution is often just a matter of breaking things down, being patient, and thinking critically. I no longer see obstacles as roadblocks, but as opportunities for growth.<br>Every piece of code I write and every project I work on forces me to think critically and logically. For example, programming teaches you how to break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. This “divide and conquer” approach is something I now apply in tackling a challenge.

Before studying computing, I didn’t realize how important logical thinking and attention to detail were in solving real-world problems. Now, I’m much more focused on analyzing situations, looking for patterns, and thinking through different possibilities before jumping into a solution. Whether it’s debugging code or organizing my thoughts in a debate, the analytical tools I’m gaining through computing are shaping the way I approach challenges in general.
<br>Computing, at its core, is about problem-solving, and problem-solving takes time. When you’re working with code, things don’t always work on the first try, or even the tenth. But what I’ve learned is that patience is key. Over time, I’ve developed the ability to step back, analyze the problem from different angles, and keep pushing forward even when things aren’t going as planned.

At first, this was incredibly frustrating. But now, I see the value in persistence. Every time I push through a particularly tough bug or a concept that’s hard to grasp, I feel stronger and more capable. I’ve learned that even when I feel stuck, it’s just part of the learning curve. The breakthroughs feel that much more rewarding after the struggle, and that sense of accomplishment is addictive.<br>When I first started, I viewed computing as a technical skill—a way to make things work or solve small, isolated problems. But now, I see it as a lens through which I can understand the world in a completely new way. Computing is not just about writing software or fixing bugs. It’s about creating systems, solving global challenges, and shaping the future.<br>As I continue my studies, I’m constantly amazed at how much I’m learning and how much I’ve changed. Computing is more than just a technical skill—it’s reshaping the way I think, work, and view the world. The skills I’m developing—problem-solving, analytical thinking, persistence, are all helping me become a more resourceful, adaptable, and innovative person.

Looking ahead, I’m excited to continue my transformation. There’s so much more to learn and so many ways I can apply what I’m studying to real-world challenges. Every day, I feel more confident in my ability to not only understand the intricacies of technology but to use it to create, innovate, and contribute to a larger purpose.

If you’re considering studying computing—or if you’re already on this journey—you might not fully realize how transformative it can be. It’s not just about learning to code; it’s about developing a mindset, a way of approaching challenges, and a sense of purpose. And that’s something that extends far beyond sitting down with a laptop.

  <h3 id="third_post">My Third Post</h3>
  <p>Some of the most interesting chapters in my computing journey has been the experience of getting stuck on a project—feeling completely overwhelmed, only to push through and have that “aha” moment. It’s a feeling that anyone in the tech world can relate to: sitting in front of lines of code, puzzling over an error that seems impossible to fix, or grappling with a concept that just won't click.<br>

I remember a specific project where I was hitting a wall, unsure of how to move forward. At that point, i was new into programming, but the challenge I faced felt like a whole new level of complexity. I wasn’t just wrestling with lines of code; I was wrestling with my own sense of frustration and doubt. The solution seemed just out of reach.

That’s when my wife—who doesn’t work in tech—checked in with me. She saw how stuck I was, and though she didn’t have the technical knowledge, her simple act of checking in meant a lot. Sometimes, just having someone acknowledge the struggle can give you the emotional boost to keep pushing. And her perspective helped me step back, take a breath, and approach the problem from a fresh angle even though eventually had to seek help from a friend who was a bit deep into tech.<br>

Even after that, there were moments when I struggled to fully understand certain programs or concepts. It was frustrating at times. But the breakthrough came, as it always does, in the small wins. Eventually, the code I had been battling with started to make sense. The programs I had once found confusing clicked into place. It wasn't magic—it was persistence, a willingness to ask questions (even of myself), and time.<br>

Looking back, those moments of struggle—being stuck on a problem, feeling misunderstood, and having to fight through that doubt—are some of the most rewarding parts of the journey. It’s in those moments that you grow the most, both as a developer and as a person. I learned that the best solutions often come after the toughest challenges, and sometimes the key to breaking through is simply refusing to give up.
